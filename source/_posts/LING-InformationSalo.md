We live in an Information Age, where computers have become an integral part of our daily lives. Personally, I work with a computer every day, constantly exploring and seeking out better programming tools like Python and other languages. It's difficult for me to imagine a life without a computer, as I have realized that I spend a significant amount of time using one. Additionally, news apps have become a crucial source of information for us.

However, it's important to be aware that our reliance on technology and the influence of companies can sometimes impact our thoughts and perceptions. By presenting information in a controlled and easily digestible manner, companies can shape our understanding of the world. It's essential to maintain critical thinking skills and seek diverse sources of information to ensure a well-rounded perspective.

Please note that the impact of technology and media on our lives is a complex and multifaceted topic. It's important to engage in thoughtful discussions and consider various viewpoints to gain a comprehensive understanding of the subject.
